|Todo| Evaluation cache [search]

At least avoid double evaluation, eg after null move.
(Or: evaluate both sides at the same time, bacause of w/b
difference due to tempo and hanging piece component?)

|Todo| Checks in qsearch, at least in PV [search]

#define minDepth -7
scout:
        if (inCheck)
                qSearchWithCheck // horizon()
        else

|Todo| Strong moves in PV qsearch [search]

Good moves: those that improve eval more than the tempo loss
aka PV tip extensions
Simplest is to keep all moves and let recursion+evaluation cull the bad ones?
This can work. But bad captures should still be pruned

|Todo| Checks after null move [search]

|Todo| Evaluation filtering for null move (retry) [search]

Prerequisite: cache evaluations to prevent the NPS drop

|Todo| Move classes [search]

  tactical      Discover from the to-square and board
  safe          From SEE bits
  strong        Discover after makeMove (from evaluate)
  check         Discover after makeMove (from attacks)
  pawn          From the move tag bits

  strong: moveScore == -1 and deltaEval > 0
  weak:   moveScore < -1 or deltaEval <= 0

  isPromotion(move)    (moveTag(move) >= promoteBishopTag)
  isTacticalMove(move) (board[to(move)] != empty or isPromotion(move))
  isSafeMove(move)     (moveScore(move) >= -1)

  isCheckingMove(move) (inCheck())     // after makeMove
  isPawnMove(move)     (moveTag(move) == movePawnTag)

Flags must support more ordering:
1. Hash move
2. Good captures
3. Killer moves
4. Counter moves (1st and 2nd order), connected moves
5. Safe checks
6. Bad captures
7. Strong moves
8. Weak moves

|Todo| Undo reductions for difficult sub-trees [search]

Positions with biggest subtree should be unreduced and retried?

|Todo| Don't reduce and then drop directly into qsearch [search]

But allow this for futility?

|Todo| History with (piece, to) instead of (from, to) [search]

|Todo| Do futility filtering before makeMove [speed]

Need 'isCheckMove' function however
isCheckMove()
{
        1. New piece gives check on to-square
        2. Piece discovers check
                If it is attacked by the right type of slider, and
                in the right direction, and
                without path to king being blocked, and
                and the move is away from that attacking line
}
+12% nps expected

|Todo| Upcoming repetition detection

|Todo| Underpromotion pruning [search]

In qsearch
 Only queening and knights that give check
 If depth >= xxx, add underpromotions, but reduce depth

 Problem with reducing underpromotions could be that the can
 transpose into the same line as queening, and then wreck the
 hash table?  Not if queen goes first? Higher depth etc

                Why wouldn't it be able to advance?

        - In that position, if there are two sentries
                Then there must also be support of a helper
        Thats it?
        - Sentry must not be mobile (but then we can make a passer)

Idea 3: If second move is not disjoint, it is not an easy move.
Disjoint means different from and to squares (maybe also include
intermediate squares in this definition): moves that can be made in
arbitrary order.
