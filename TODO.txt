Tentative release notes for v0.9:
- Gained approximately 125 elo at fast time controls
- Better handling of zugzwang positions
- Fixed illegal moves deep in PV (reported by Dirk-Jan D.)
- Full solution for the "0readyok" problem: also don't split info lines
- Able to abort search in Python module (e.g. by Ctrl-C)
Under the hood:
- Added history counters for move ordering
- Improved move ordering for killers
- Improved null move pruning/reductions (aka verification)
- Added delta pruning
- Hanging piece evaluation
- Simple dynamic futility pruning
- Minor evaluation weight tuning
- Simplified UCI move printing

|Todo| Depth promotion of qsearch entries [search,ttable]

Use "depth 0 fail highs with a move" also when probing with depth 1

For example, do this by storing them as depth 1, so they also stay
in the table a bit longer.

|Todo| Simple futility-2 [search]

|Todo| Razoring [search]

|Todo| Evaluation cache [search]

At least avoid double evaluation, eg after null move.
(Or: evaluate both sides at the same time, bacause of w/b
difference due to tempo and hanging piece component?)

|Todo| Checks in qsearch, at least in PV [search]

#define minDepth -7

|Todo| Strong moves in PV qsearch [search]

Simplest is to keep all moves and let recursion+evaluation cull the bad ones.

|Todo| Checks after null move [search]

|Todo| Evaluation filtering for null move (retry) [search]

Cache evaluations to prevent the NPS drop

|Todo| Move classes [search]

  tactical      Discover from to-square and board
  safe          From SEE bits
  strong        Discover after makeMove (from evaluate)
  check         Discover after makeMove (from attacks)
  pawn          From special bits

  strong: moveScore == -1 and deltaEval > 0
  weak:   moveScore < -1 or deltaEval <= 0

  isPromotion(move)    (moveTag(move) >= promoteBishopTag)
  isTacticalMove(move) (board[to(move)] != empty or isPromotion(move))
  isSafeMove(move)     (moveScore(move) >= -1)

  isCheckingMove(move) (inCheck())     // after makeMove
  isPawnMove(move)     (moveTag(move) == movePawnTag)

Flags must support more ordering:
1. Hash move
2. Good captures
3. Killer moves

5. Safe checks
6. Bad captures
7. Strong moves
8. Weak moves

|Todo| Collect statistics for delta pruning [search]

|Todo| Undo reductions for difficult sub-trees [search]

Positions with biggest subtree should be unreduced and retried?

|Todo| Don't reduce and then drop directly into qsearch [search]

But allow this for futility?

|Todo| History with (piece, to) instead of (from, to) [search]

At least include color

Redesignate special bits as follows:
        P  NBR Q  K

|Todo| Remember more than 1 good move in PV nodes

|Todo| More agressive null move tuning

 Reduction for
   weakquiet moves or bad checks

|Todo| Inverse delta pruning [search]

                // Inverse delta pruning
                assert(moveList[0] >= 0);
                int minDelta = (moveList[0] >> 26) * 1000 - 1000;
                if (minDelta > alpha - bestScore)
                        return ttWrite(self, slot, 0, bestScore + minDelta, alpha, alpha+1);
        }

|Todo| Upcoming repetition detection

|Todo| Underpromotion pruning [search]

In qsearch
 Only queening and knights that give check
 If depth >= xxx, add underpromotions, but reduce depth

 Problem with reducing underpromotions could be that the can
 transpose into the same line as queening, and then wreck the
 hash table?  Not if queen goes first? Higher depth etc

|Ongoing| Hanging piece evaluation [evaluate]

- Weights depend on side to move: total 6 parameters to tune
- Rethink mobility as well

|Todo| Sneaker (hidden passed pawn) [evaluate]

        Passed pawn, if not blocked
        Helper can sacrifice itself to make a passer

|Todo| Candidate passer [evaluate]

1. Floyd type: check that the helpers are on the right spot
2. Fruit type: just see if the helpers outnumber the sentries

|Todo| Passer scoring based on table instead of quad [evaluate]

|Todo| Pawn levers [evaluate]

|Todo| Board control: what can I drop on a square [evaluate]

|Todo| Potential open files [evaluate]

- potential open files for rooks
Require that the number of helpers is at least the number of sentries

Potential open file:
        - Not doubled pawn
        - The pawn can advance to meet a sentry
                Why wouldn't it be able to advance?
                        Only if there is no sentry
        - In that position, if there are two sentries
                Then there must also be support of a helper
        Thats it?
        - Sentry must not be mobile (but then we can make a passer)

        Score by file (a-file is probably very good)
        Score by rank of the pawn
        Score by rank of the sentry?
        Score by difference in moves/squares?

|Todo| Alekhine's Gun [evaluate]

"I should mention, too that you do need to handle stacked attackers
such as "Alekhine's Gun". This is commonly done by considering own
rooks as transparent when calculating rank/file attacks, as well
as as Queens being "transparent" when considering Bishop attacks."

        Fixes on release give a new release
"int": upcoming release branch, for integration testing
        push into master and dev
"dev": fast-paced changes
        merge dev into int to start preparing next release
        Then only allow fixes
        Make release notes
        Merge into master

Make branch:
        git checkout dev
        git checkout -b v0.8

Merge release into master:
        git checkout master
        git merge --no-ff v0.8
        git branch -d v0.8
        git push origin dev

|Todo| Reject illegal positions [usability]

- pawns on rank 1 and 8
- not one king per side
- too many pawns or promoted pieces
- side to move attacks other king

- also update chessmoves module for this

|Todo| Accept a lambda as value to `info' in search() [python]

Also recognize 50-move as a game during search.

|Todo| Move logit() from evaluate to rootSearch [speed]

|Todo| Calculate the impact of each parameter [tune]

Lazy method: set each to 0 and compute the delta of the residual

|Todo| Auto jitter monitoring [timecontrol]

Keep track of maximum jitter in a session, and use that instead of the
2.5 seconds safety margin. Then see if we can reduce 2.5 to 0.5 with this
and gain some fake elo at ultra fast tc.

|Todo| Principle component analysis [tune]

For decorrelation of parameters

|Todo| Clearer handling of minmovetime [timecontrol]

Now we increase safety to 20 s when increment is (almost) 0.
This is double indirect:
1. Associating "inc=0" with "minmovetime"
2. Putting the solution in "safety", instead of elsewhere
There must be a cleaner way

|Todo| Rename pawnKingHash [qa]

Because we want to add bishop colors as well, and
reduce the king component to their files.

Candidates (best first):
        subHash <-- looks best
        miniHash
        pkbHash
        coarseHash
        hash2
        pawnHash
        structHash
        xHash
        pHash
        slowHash

|Todo| Cleanup header files [qa]
