|Todo| Lazy move generation for pvSearch

|Todo| Introduce move flags for 32 bit

- Simplify UCI move formatting

|Todo| Extend move flags

- Extend flags beyond 

Concept choice: keep flags with move or in seperate table
or combine with the move word?

          search                     board
+------------+------------+------------+-------------+
| SEE/killer |   history  | properties |     move    |
+------------+------------+------------+-------------+
      16            16           16           16

        moveList[i] += self->history[moveList[i] & moveMask]

1. Sort a long key.
        - Makes everyone upgrade to Move_t
        + Can use standard qsort
2. Sort only the scores, with back reference to the move (index)
3. Sort through a history table, requires modified qsort
4. Hide all in a move picker object
5. Place scores at index+256
        - Doesn't work with qsort

Desirable properties
- generateMove still generates ints (32bit)
- can use stdlib qsort

|Todo| Lazy move generation for qSearch
Makes it slower?

|Todo| Try simple SEE

|Todo| Win64 version from Makefile [win64]

|Todo| Learn how to branch in git :-) [git]

Make Docs/branching.txt

http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/

"master": releases
"patch": for fixes on release. Short lived. Push into int and into master
        Fixes on release give a new release
"int": upcoming release branch, for integration testing
        push into master and dev
"dev": fast-paced changes
        merge dev into int to start preparing next release
        Then only allow fixes
        Make release notes
        Merge into master

Go through eval_comp forwards and backwards again and
take many things.

|Todo| Measure repeatibility of tuner [verification,tune]

Tune with 10 different subsets of ccrl @ 1M
Observe variation of vector and residual 

Tune with 10 different subsets of ccrl @ 100k
Observe variation of vector and residual 

|Todo| Get residuals of some existing evaluations for comparison [evaluate]

|Todo| Consider gradient descent [tune]

|Todo| Test tuner on Rosenbrock function [tune]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosenbrock_function

|Todo| Parameter graphs (tune.dir) [tune]

|Todo| Reject illegal positions [usability]

- pawns on rank 1 and 8
- not one king per side
- too many pawns or promoted pieces
- side to move attacks other king

- also update chessmoves module for this

|Todo| In debugging mode give moves also in SAN for readability

|Todo| Accept a lambda as value to `info' in search() [python]

As a callback interface with the search info data

|Todo| Move ordering based on delta eval [search]

Then also cache evaluation in ttable

floyd [ <uciCommand> <uciOption> ... ]

eg.
floyd go depth 8
floyd help
floyd bench

Also recognize 50-move as a game during search.

|Todo| Compile on FreeBSD [qa]

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Avoid system-in-system effect:
Things that definitely don't belong in a chess engine:
- PGN reading and writing
- Logging facilities
- SAN reading and writing
- libreadline
- Configuration files
- Over-pedantic checks: input validation for other conditions than those
  that can crash the implementation later on
- Recovery from system failures. Instead log failure and abort
- Checking for system/library compliancy to their specification
