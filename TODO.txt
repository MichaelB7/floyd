|Todo| Delay 256MB allocation until 'isready'. [uci]

But do something safe if isready is skipped.
Eg. Also check in 'go' or 'rootSearch' if there is a table.

|Todo| Internal deepening [search]

+27 -53 -20 (-92 elo)

|Todo| Residual degradation

Now:
vector filename 'vector.json' residual 0.331991650 positions 3000000 depth 0

Was:
vector filename vector.json residual 0.322688640 positions 3000000 depth 0

|Todo| Canary / high-water mark on undo stack [qa]

At least when debugging is compiled in

|Todo| Try MVA/LVA instead of fake-SEE

|Todo| Pondering [uci]

moves 5 (includes divide, no time info)

|Todo| Enable test before install [build]

|Todo| Multicore support for tuning [speed]

|Todo| King safety [evaluate]

|Todo| Left-right location parameters [evaluate]

|Todo| Before breaking out the tune loop, do a quadratic fit on the
       nearest 3 points and probe the bottom [tune]

|Todo| Experiment: tune each bishop square [evaluate]

|Todo| Expand board control. Include mobility [evaluate]

|Todo| Add white/black testing [qa,evaluate]

|Todo| Add left/right testing [qa,evaluate]

|Todo| Terminology: coefficient or parameter [qa]

|Todo| Check Rebel evaluation features [evaluate]

Ref: http://www.top-5000.nl/authors/rebel/chess840.htm

|Todo| Check Stockfish evaluation features [evaluate]

|Todo| Check "Fruit/Rybka" evaluation features [evaluate]

Go through eval_comp forwards and backwards again and
take many things.

|Todo| LittleChessEvaluationCompendium.pdf [evaluate]

|Todo| Measure repeatibility of tuner [verification,tune]

Tune with 10 different subsets of ccrl @ 1M
Observe variation of vector and residual 

Tune with 10 different subsets of ccrl @ 100k
Observe variation of vector and residual 

|Todo| Get residuals of some existing evaluations for comparison [evaluate]

 - Crafty 24.1
 - Stockfish 6
 - Fruit 2.1
 - Junior 2011
 - Hiarcs 14
 - Shredder 12
 - Komodo x?
 - Gnucheese
 - Rookie 3.8

|Todo| Parameter graphs (tune.dir) [tune]

|Todo| Reject illegal positions [usability]

- pawns on rank 1 and 8
- not one king per side
- too many pawns or promoted pieces
- side to move attacks other king

- also update chessmoves module for this

|Todo| Export version string to Python [python]

|Todo| In debugging mode give moves also in SAN for readability

|Todo| Replace alarm() timer with something with better granularity [search]

|Todo| Compile for windows [os,win]

|Todo| Accept a lambda as value to `info' in search() [python]

As a callback interface with the search info data

|Todo| Move ordering based on delta eval [search]

Then also cache evaluation in ttable

|Todo| Execute command line arguments as uci command [main,usability]
