|Todo| Linux and/or cutechess-gui [bug,floyd0.5]

Reported by Antonio Arias:
"""I've tested floyd in Linux 64 bits OS in cutechess-gui since the
first versions (commit 82).  It worked until commit 102.  Now since
commit 102 none of the versions start in cutechess-gui.  I've found
the culprit.  It's the file uci.c.  If I copy that file from commit
102 or earlier to the versions after commit 102, floyd works fine.
I've narrowed the problem and it seems that changing the strcmp(command,
x) function to scan(x) in the newer versions doesn't work in Linux.
I've also tested your pre-compiled binary v0.5 for linux 64 bits
and it doesn't start in cutechess-gui."""
