|Todo| Left-right location parameters [evaluate]

|Todo| Pawn mobility [evaluate]

Can it move safely & how far

|Todo| Pawn levers [evaluate]

Can it come in contact with an enemy pawn?
(This relation is mutal, so what is the point)

|Todo| Rooks and queens on open files [evaluate]

|Todo| Log timestamp of most recent tune [tune]
|Todo| Keep track of last non-zero delta for parameter ordering [tune]

For example: (count, lastDelta, timestamp)

Initial: (0, delta, t)
Update:
if newDelta < 0.0:
        return (0, newDelta, tNow)
else:
        return (count+1, lastDelta, tNow)

|Todo| Introduction of material table [speed]

Floyd is slow, but we should aim to keep it above 1Mnps

|Todo| Check Rebel evaluation features [evaluate]

Go through eval_comp forwards and backwards again and
take many things.

|Todo| Expand board control. Include mobility [evaluate]

|Todo| Add white/black testing [qa,evaluate]

|Todo| Add left/right testing [qa,evaluate]

|Todo| Introduce move flags for 32 bit

- Simplify UCI move formatting

|Todo| Extend move flags

- Extend flags beyond 

Concept choice: keep flags with move or in seperate table?

          search                     board
+------------+------------+------------+-------------+
| SEE/killer |   history  | properties |     move    |
+------------+------------+------------+-------------+
      16            16           16           16

        moveList[i] += self->history[moveList[i] & moveMask]

1. Sort a long key.
        - Makes everyone migrate to Move_t
        + Can use standard qsort
2. Sort only the scores, with back reference to the move (index)
3. Sort through a history table, requires modified qsort
4. Hide all in a move picker object
5. Place scores at index+256
        - Doesn't work with qsort

Desirable properties
- generateMoves still generates ints (32bit)
- can use stdlib qsort

|Todo| Win64 version from Makefile [win64]

|Todo| Learn how to branch in git :-) [git]

Make Docs/branching.txt

http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/

"master": releases
"patch": for fixes on release. Short lived. Push into int and into master
        Fixes on release give a new release
"int": upcoming release branch, for integration testing
        push into master and dev
"dev": fast-paced changes
        merge dev into int to start preparing next release
        Then only allow fixes
        Make release notes
        Merge into master
