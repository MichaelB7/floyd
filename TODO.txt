|Todo| Release notes for 0.7

Draft:
Strength increase of ~150 elo at fast time controls.
Adding of basic killers.
Adding of "moves [ depth <ply> ]" command.
Adding of UCI "mate" option, mate distance pruning and stop condition.
Basic cut node reductions.
Simple lazy move generation for scout.
Faster evaluation weight tuning.
General code cleanup, such as the removal of needless SAN output code.
Slightly improved passer evaluation.
Introduction of material table.

|Todo| Mate option [uci]

------------------------------------------------------------------------

|Todo| Scale passers with material [evaluate]

|Todo| King safety [evaluate]

|Todo| Rooks and queens on open files [evaluate]

|Todo| Don't allow 0 as heuristic evalation [evaluate]

|Todo| Left-right location parameters [evaluate]

|Todo| Check Rebel evaluation features [evaluate]

Ref: http://www.top-5000.nl/authors/rebel/chess840.htm

|Todo| Check Stockfish evaluation features [evaluate]

|Todo| Check "Fruit/Rybka" evaluation features [evaluate]

Go through eval_comp forwards and backwards again and
take many things.

|Todo| Experiment: tune each bishop square [evaluate]

|Todo| Expand board control. Include mobility [evaluate]

|Todo| Add white/black testing [qa,evaluate]

|Todo| Add left/right testing [qa,evaluate]

|Todo| Introduce move flags for 32 bit

- Simplify UCI move formatting

|Todo| Extend move flags

- Extend flags beyond 

Concept choice: keep flags with move or in seperate table?

          search                     board
+------------+------------+------------+-------------+
| SEE/killer |   history  | properties |     move    |
+------------+------------+------------+-------------+
      16            16           16           16

        moveList[i] += self->history[moveList[i] & moveMask]

1. Sort a long key.
        - Makes everyone migrate to Move_t
        + Can use standard qsort
2. Sort only the scores, with back reference to the move (index)
3. Sort through a history table, requires modified qsort
4. Hide all in a move picker object
5. Place scores at index+256
        - Doesn't work with qsort

Desirable properties
- generateMoves still generates ints (32bit)
- can use stdlib qsort

|Todo| Win64 version from Makefile [win64]

Joost: Intel C compiler versie 15
https://software.intel.com/en-us/qualify-for-free-software

|Todo| Learn how to branch in git :-) [git]

Make Docs/branching.txt

http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/

"master": releases
"patch": for fixes on release. Short lived. Push into int and into master
        Fixes on release give a new release
"int": upcoming release branch, for integration testing
        push into master and dev
"dev": fast-paced changes
        merge dev into int to start preparing next release
        Then only allow fixes
        Make release notes
        Merge into master

|Todo| Basic history [search]

|Todo| Basic counter move? [search]

|Todo| Checks in qsearch, at least in PV

#define minDepth -7

|Todo| Granularity of win32 clock too low? [win32]

|Todo| Multicore support for tuning [speed]

|Todo| Terminology: coefficient or parameter [qa]

|Todo| Measure repeatibility of tuner [verification,tune]

Tune with 10 different subsets of ccrl @ 1M
Observe variation of vector and residual 

Tune with 10 different subsets of ccrl @ 100k
Observe variation of vector and residual 

|Todo| Get residuals of some existing evaluations for comparison [evaluate]

 - Crafty 24.1
 - Fruit 2.1
 - Giraffe
 - Gnucheese
 - Hiarcs 14
 - Junior 2011
 - Komodo x?
 - Rookie 3.9
 - Rybka 2.3.2a

|Todo| Consider gradient descent [tune]

|Todo| Test tuner on Rosenbrock function [tune]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosenbrock_function

|Todo| Parameter graphs (tune.dir) [tune]

|Todo| Reject illegal positions [usability]

- pawns on rank 1 and 8
- not one king per side
- too many pawns or promoted pieces
- side to move attacks other king

- also update chessmoves module for this

|Todo| Accept a lambda as value to `info' in search() [python]

As a callback interface with the search info data

|Todo| Move ordering based on delta eval [search]

Then also cache evaluation in ttable

|Todo| Execute command line arguments as uci command [main,usability]

floyd [ <uciCommand> <uciOption> ... ]

eg.
floyd 'debug on'
floyd 'go depth 8'
floyd help
floyd bench

Main obstacle is that the token scanner assumes there is always a
whitespace or newline after each word.

|Todo| Consider persistent alarm thread [speed]

Profile first

|Todo| Consider persistent search thread [speed]

Profile first

|Todo| Implement 50 move rule [50move]

Also recognize 50-move as a game during search.

|Todo| Compile on FreeBSD [qa]

|Todo| Pondering [uci]

|Todo| Move generator test [qa]

moves 5 (includes divide, no time info)

|Todo| eggs metadata [python]

|Todo| Best of <n> benchmark [qa]

First verify that variance of the extreme is indeed better than
the variance of the mean.

See timing.log and timing3.log

|Todo| Move logit() from evaluate to rootSearch [speed]
